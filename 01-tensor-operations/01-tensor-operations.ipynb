Before using this function, one needs to understand when exactly they need their data logarithmically spaced out because sometimes, it might be better to use a linear spacing instead. So when would you want to use one data spacing type over the other? Simply put, if you're modeling something that relies on some internal relative change ($\\textit{multiplicative}$) mechanism, then a logarithmic spacing would allow you to capture the patterns in this mechanism more accurately than a linear spacing would. Similarly, if you're modeling something that relies on some internal absolute change ($\\textit{additive}$) mechanism, then a linear spacing would allow you to capture the patterns in this mechanism more accurately than a logarithmic spacing would."
